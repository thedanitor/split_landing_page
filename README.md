# Split Landing Page

https://thedanitor.github.io/split_landing_page/

This project is from the Day 7 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

Interesting feature. I can't think of a whole lot of use cases outside of marketing/advertising, but the overall concept could be modified for many different uses.

### Things Learned

* ::before will insert content preceding specified selector(s)
* Can horizontally center text in container by position: absolute, left: 50%, transform: translateX(-50%) if container is positioned
* 1 rem is the font-size of the html element (default is 16px)
