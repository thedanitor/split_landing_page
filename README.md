# Split Landing Page

https://thedanitor.github.io/split_landing_page/

This project is from the Day 7 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.
